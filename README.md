# 🌾 Crop and Profit Recommendation for Sustainable Farming

A Decision Support System (DSS) that recommends **the top 3 crops** based on
**climate conditions, land area, expected profit, and risk level** using
historical agricultural and economic data.

---

## 📌 Project Description
This project helps farmers and decision-makers choose suitable crops by
combining **temperature, rainfall, cost, and profit variability**
into a single, explainable decision-support framework.

The system is implemented using:
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis and preprocessing
- **Streamlit** for an interactive web-based dashboard
