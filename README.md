# 🌾 Crop and Profit Recommendation for Sustainable Farming

A **Decision Support System (DSS)** that recommends the **top 3 suitable crops** based on  
**climate conditions, land area, expected profit, and risk level**, using historical
agricultural and economic data.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project helps farmers and decision-makers choose suitable crops by combining
**temperature, rainfall, land area, cost, and profit variability** into a single,
transparent, and explainable decision-support framework.

The system is implemented using:
- **Jupyter Notebook** for data analysis and preprocessing  
- **Streamlit** for an interactive web-based dashboard
